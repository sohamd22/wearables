                    Wearable technology, also known as "wearables," is a category of electronic devices
                    that can be worn as accessories, embedded in clothing, implanted in the user's body, or even
                    tattooed on the skin.

            <h2>Health Wearables</h2>
            <p>
                Wearables are most associated with the health and wellness sectors. Smart watches, like a Fitbit or
                Apple
                Watch, have pioneered the way we track everything from heart rates to our daily steps. Constantly
                checking in with them have become part of a daily routine for millions
                of people across the globe. These watches inherently encourage healthier lifestyles because of the data
                they collect. Knowing how far you ran encourages you to push yourself further to beat your old record.
                Seeing that youâ€™re almost to your daily 10,000 step goal encourages you to go for a walk around the
                block. Even tracking your current sleep habits could lead to changes that help you sleep more soundly at
                night. In a sense, wearable technology is one of the best ways to better the health and wellness
                journey.

            <h2>Gaming Wearables</h2>
            <p>
                Gaming is one of the biggest emerging frontiers for wearable technology. Virtual Reality (VR) headsets
                are the most popular form of wearables in the industry. They instantly immerse gamers in
                other-worldly experiences from the second they strap
                in. VR wearables are bringing awe-inspiring
                experiences like fighting with lightsabers and driving their dream cars to gamers all over the world.
                Haptic Devices, which are rising rapidly, provide tactile feedback to a gamer in
                real-time. The device takes advantage of a gamerâ€™s sense of touch by providing force or
                vibrations to a user. In short, haptic vests, gloves or suits make gaming more realistic. A
                gamer can now feel actual recoil after shooting their virtual weapon or can even experience the feeling
                of dribbling a virtual basketball. Though still in its infancy, haptic
                technology is poised to make the future of gaming, and wearables, more entertaining and realistic.

            <h2>Fashion Wearables</h2>
            <p>
                It only makes sense that wearable technology has started to permeate fashion culture. Athletes wear full
                body suits, equipped with hundreds of little IoT sensors, to measure their every move. The data gathered
                will help them to better optimize their swing, shot or kick. The consumer wearable technology clothing
                industry is still relatively new, albeit already intriguing. Smart jackets are being made to
                automatically cool or warm the body based on body temperatures taken from sensors throughout the jacket.
                Smart rings are giving people a stylish way to track their steps or measure their sleep habits. Our
                pants might one day become smart enough to use the thermal energy our bodies naturally produce to charge
                our cell phones. Wearable technology in fashion is showing us that tech can be smart and sophisticated
                all at once.

                <h1>Future Of <span>Wearables</span></h1>
                <p>
                    The future of wearable technology is predicted to go far beyond fitness trackers and VRs, with
                    claims
                    that wearables can be implanted into the user's brain to send digital information straight to the
                    brain.
                    Future wearables could also be more hidden, smaller, and even personalized to your own needs while
                    at
                    the same time being eco-friendly.
